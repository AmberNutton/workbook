# Exercises

You'll walk through exercises for the Develop stage.

## Exercise 1: Co-Creation Cycle

Choose one of your solutions from the Discern stage and go through one iteration of the Co-Creation Cycle:

1. Request: Write a prayer inviting the Holy Spirit into your development process.
2. Receive: Spend 10 minutes in silence, listening for guidance. Note any thoughts, images, or scriptures that come to mind.
3. Review: Summarize the insights you received.
4. Render: Outline the next steps for implementing these insights.
5. Rejoice: Write a short prayer of thanksgiving for God's guidance.

## Reflection Questions

- How did this process differ from your usual development approach?
- What challenges did you face in trying to co-create with the Holy Spirit?

Remember, the Develop stage is about partnering with God in the creation process. Stay open to His guidance and be willing to adjust your plans as you receive new insights.
