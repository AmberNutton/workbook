# Exercises

You'll walk through exercises for the Discern stage.

## Exercise 1: "How Might Jesus" Brainstorming

1. Reframe your problem statement as a "How Might Jesus" question. For example, "How might Jesus address social media addiction?"
2. Brainstorm at least 10 possible approaches or solutions, keeping in mind Jesus' teachings and character.

## Exercise 2: 3RC Analysis

For each of your brainstormed solutions, categorize them into one of the four 3RC postures:

1. Reject
2. Receive
3. Reimagine
4. Create

Explain your reasoning for each categorization.

## Reflection Questions

- Which posture(s) did you find yourself gravitating towards most often? Why?
- How does the "How Might Jesus" framing change your approach to problem-solving?

In this stage, we seek God's wisdom and discernment in approaching the problem. Remember to remain open to unexpected solutions and approaches that align with Christ's teachings.
