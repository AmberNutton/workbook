# Exercises

You'll walk through exercises for the Demonstrate stage.

## Exercise 1: Redemptive Impact Planning

1. Identify 3-5 key relationships that will be impacted by your solution (e.g., team members, beneficiaries, partners).
2. For each relationship, outline:
   - Current state of the relationship
   - Desired state after implementing your solution
   - Specific actions you can take to deepen this relationship over time

## Exercise 2: Measuring Redemptive Impact

Create a simple framework for measuring the redemptive impact of your solution. Consider:

- Depth of relationships formed
- Spiritual growth of team members and beneficiaries
- Long-term community transformation

## Reflection Questions

- How does this view of impact challenge traditional metrics of success in technology?
- In what ways might this approach to demonstrating impact change your development process?

In the Demonstrate stage, we focus on the relational and spiritual impact of our work. Remember that true redemptive impact often takes time and is measured in transformed lives and communities.
